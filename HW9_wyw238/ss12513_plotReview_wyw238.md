## CLARITY
The graph is clear and intuitive. Different zipcode areas are labeled, and the various sales price groups are indicated clearly in the legend. However, since the prices are grouped into colors that are different in hue, some colors are very close and can be hard to discern at a quick glimpse.
## ESTHETIC
The graph is functionally esthetic. I ran a color-blind test, and the graph passed all the tests. 
## HONESTY
The graph marks all the information clearly, and I think there is no trace of intentional manipulation. One piece of advice is that since some zip areas are larger than others, the average sales price might not be very meaningful for comparison. However, this graph does serve the original purpose.
