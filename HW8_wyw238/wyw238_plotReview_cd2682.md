## Reviews:
- Clarity: The plot is friendly to read but maybe you would like to improve it to help better understanding its meanings.
  - Possible improvements:
    - clarify the definition of 'Fraction of rides'
    - clarify the purple parts mean a overlap of red and blue
    - replace 'older' with 'senior' and identify the standard of dividing the users

- Esthetic:
  - The colors: Good
  - Appropriate to represent the quantities

- Honesty: The plot honestly reproducing the data.
