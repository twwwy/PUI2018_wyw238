This is a informative and straightforward bar plot. The plot itself is really clear, which rightly showing the proportion of younger and older bikers on each day of a week. However, if we consider this as a independent plot, the attached legend is a little ambiguous. Weiyun could change the term used in the legend, the Younger bikers and Older bikers, to a more descriptive and clear term, like Biker < 60 years old and Bikers > 60 years old. Additionally, using bar plot is a good choice to reflect the data, because it allows audience effortlessly focus on the normalized difference of the distribution of the two types of bikers. However, overlapping the two bars for each types of bikers is, to a certain degree, misleading. For example, from the legend, we can only find out two colors, red and blue, but in the plot, there is another color, purple, which is a result of overlapping two bars. Weiyun may consider to either serperate the two bars, or enforcing the color of the overlapping area to be the color of the bar which has less proportion.
